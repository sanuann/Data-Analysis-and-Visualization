## Projects:
### 1. Titanic challenge - Kaggle
### 2. [Housing Prices in College Towns during Recession](https://github.com/sanuann/Data-Science-with-Python/blob/master/src/Housing%20Prices.ipynb)
We test whether university towns significantly different mean housing prices during recessions from non-university towns. We run a t-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom. We find that university towns have a lower market loss during recessions.

The following data files are used in this project:

From the Zillow research data site there is housing data for the United States. In particular the datafile for all homes at a city level has median home sale prices at a fine grained level.

From the Wikipedia page on college towns is a list of university towns in the United States which has been copy and pasted into the file university_towns.txt.

From the Bureau of Economic Analysis, US Department of Commerce, the GDP over time of the United States in current dollars, in quarterly intervals. For this project, we only look at GDP data from the first quarter of 2000 onward.
